```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Let's load interviews

We shall play with interviews SAFI data. It contains data such as: 

- village 
- household size (hh_members)
- number of lifestock (liv_count)



```{r load-interviews, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
interviews <- read_csv("data/SAFI_clean.csv")
glimpse(interviews)
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
